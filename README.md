# Modelling Motor Insurance Claims Data.

This repository contains R code for building, cleaning, and modeling motor insurance claim frequency and severity data using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). The code includes data preparation, feature engineering, and model testing for Poisson and Negative Binomial GLMs.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The repository consists of the following files:
- `DataCleaning_v8`: Script for cleaning and preparing motor insurance claims data.
- `FREQUENCY MODEL CHOICE.R`: Script for building and testing GLMs, including Poisson for claim frequency.

## üìä Objectives

The goal of this project is to:
1. Analyze motor insurance claims data.
2. Build claim frequency and severity models using Poisson and Gamma GLMs.
3. Evaluate and compare model performance with metrics like AIC, RMSE, and deviance.
